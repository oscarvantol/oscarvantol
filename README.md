# Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Oscar - a father of 4 that loves technology since I can remember, I've written my first code in the 90s and never stopped. As a developer with a passion for networks/infrastructure and hardware I got excited about the potential of Microsoft Azure early on. You can find me talking about PaaS and Serverless at conferences, on blogs or youtube whenever there is time. I am working as a Principal Cloud Architect at Betabit in The Netherland, helping out customers by architecting scalable, multi tenant, secure software. Next to that I coach teams and their organisations to become more agile in the way they design, discuss, develop and release their software.
